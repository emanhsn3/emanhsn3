Hotel Booking Demands It is an industry in itself So, it is important
to manage reservations very efficiently, based on modern technologies
such as machine learning
In this project, we tried to predict the possibility of a booking for a
hotel based on different factors and tried to predict if they need special
requests based on different features
The data set contains booking information for a city hotel It
includes information such as when the booking was made, the, and the
number of available parking spaces, Lead Time, Booking Changes, Previous
Cancellations, among other things From it, we can understand the
customer’s’ behavior and it might help us make better decisions
